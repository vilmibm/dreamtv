# dreamtv
the tv you've always dreamed of

dreamtv uses a directory hierarchy of video files to generate programming for a pseudo television. "channels" are mapped to folders of videos and lineups are randomly generated based on play statistics once a day. The video files are streamed to a webpage with a live, embedded chat so folks can watch TV together. Channels can be changed and a schedule for the day can be consulted.

## what's done:

- [x] streaming video files
- [x] front end chat
- [x] directory walking and storing file info in db
- [ ] lineup generation
- [ ] channel switching
- [ ] password setting
